MindSeed is a decentralized application dedicated to empowering university students and fostering the proliferation of research and the generation of knowledge.

Through Web3 technology, we offer students who have completed a research project or applied their knowledge practically, the opportunity to share their papers by uploading them to the blockchain. This provides them with a means to protect and authenticate their authorship while creating content that can be referenced by fellow students.

The problem:
Currently, university students across Latin America face a significant challenge regardless of their field of study. 
Educational programs tend to be highly theoretical, providing little room for experimentation or practical application of knowledge. 
There are limited incentives to engage in research projects that could genuinely impact society, beyond a few extra points on their grades.
It is frustrating for students to realize that the time and dedication they invest in their studies do not necessarily translate into the experience and skills needed to navigate the job market. 
Even if they make significant advancements in their respective fields, students often receive little recognition and benefits as "beginners" in the field.
The issue is compounded by the fact that schools retain the rights to research, deciding the extent to which they share the findings. This further hinders students from gaining visibility and acknowledgment for their contributions.

How we solve it: 
A university student who has conducted a research project or applied their expertise uploads their paper to the blockchain, ensuring that their authorship is backed and protected.
Any other student undertaking a similar study or seeking real-world examples of the theoretical principles they are learning can preview the original document and download it if they find it valuable. Each downloaded copy of the document is recorded and tallied on the blockchain.
This way, the author gains prestige as they have directly and demonstrably contributed to learning in their field of study.

Benefits:
Students have access to relevant and practical work, rather than explanations that are disconnected from their reality and already known by heart.
